<h1>About Me</h1>
<p></p>I'm Aniwat Limsuvech, a medical student from Thammasat University with a passion for coding and website creating. 
With 0.5 years of experience in coding, I've had the privilege of working on 2 projects that have honed my skills 
and shaped my approach to website creating.</P>

<p>My journey in this field began during my summer break at the Faculty of medicine. I motivated myself to do some coding
to help extended my field of knowledge. Since then, I've been dedicated to coding.</p>
